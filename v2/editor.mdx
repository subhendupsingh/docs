You can define custom variables by enclosing the variables in double curly braces `{{variable}}`.

You can clone the pre-built templates and customize them using the editor.

## Creating from scratch

You can use the editor to create your own templates from scratch. After creating the template,
you can copy its HTML or save it. When you save a template, an unique ID is generated for each
template that can be used with [Shootmail SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shootmail) to send emails using any out of the supported 
email providers.

### Add npmrc file

Add `.npmrc` file in the root directory of your app, with the following content

```bash
@shootmail:registry=https://registry.shootmail.app
```

### Login to Shootmail registry

Run `npm login` in your terminal to login to the registry

```bash
npm login --registry https://registry.shootmail.app
```

This will prompt you to enter `username` and `password` for the Shootmail registry. This username and password will be provided to you by Shootmail.

### Install Shootmail email builder in your app

Run the following command in your terminal

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @shootmail/email-builder
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @shootmail/email-builder
```
</CodeGroup>

While doing `npm install`, you might get this message:
```
This modules directory was created using the following registries configuration: {"default":"https://registry.npmjs.org/"}. The current configuration is {"default":"https://registry.npmjs.org/","@shootmail":"https://registry.shootmail.app/"}. To recreate the modules directory using the new settings, run "pnpm install".
```
You can safely press `enter` or `Y` to proceed further. This error message notifies you that previously,
all the dependencies were downloaded from the default npm registry, but since now, they will be downloaded
via Shootmail's proxy, the node_modules folder needs to be re-built. This will not change anything.

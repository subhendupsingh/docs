Shootmail SDK exports a response type `ShootmailResponse` that has following structure

```typescript
    type ShootmailResponse = {
        status: number;
        error: {
            message: string;
        } | null;
        data?: any;
    }
```

1. Status can be either `200` or `400`, depending on if the response is a success or an error.
2. If the response is **successful**, `error` is `null`, status is `200` and the data property contains the response
returned by the email provider.
3. If the response has **error**, the `data` property will be null, status will be `400` and the `error` property
will contain the error returned by the email provider.

## Success Response

```json
    {
        "data": {
            "id": "cea768fb-cc4e-4fca-aa04-07000ee3b6bc"
        },
        "status": 200,
        "error": null
    }
```

## Error Response

```json
    {
        "data": null,
        "status": 400,
        "error": {
            "message": "The mail.mystorebud.com domain is not verified. Please, add and verify your domain on https://resend.com/domains"
        }
    }
```
